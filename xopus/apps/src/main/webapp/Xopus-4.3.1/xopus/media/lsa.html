The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information if required by a governmental agency, by operation of law, or if necessary in any proceeding to establish rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party reasonable prior written notice sufficient to permit the disclosing party an opportunity to contest such disclosure.</p>
<p>11.2	Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any copying or use of the Software other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement would result in irreparable injury to SDL for which money damages would be inadequate and in such event SDL shall have the right, in addition to other remedies available at law and in equity, to immediate injunctive relief to prevent any such unauthorized use.

<p>When possible, the Licensee shall provide SDL with an appropriate remote diagnostic access mechanism for the purposes of remote problem diagnosis. SDL agrees to utilize such remote diagnostic access only in accordance with Licensee&rsquo;s and Customer&rsquo;s policies and conditions governing such access. If such remote diagnostic access is not supplied, problem diagnosis and resolution times could be significantly expanded. Any diagnostic or problem resolution work that requires on-site activities principally due to the lack of remote diagnostic access are subject to Billable Service charges which will not be initiated without the prior consent of the Licensee or Customer.</p>
<p>The Customer is responsible for implementing delivered Product Upgrades and New Versions in a timely fashion. Licensee and SDL will not be required to provide Maintenance Services related to problems reported by the Customers who elect not to install delivered Product Upgrades and New Versions containing improvements or fixes for those problems reported by the Customer.</p>
<h2>Article 9 &ndash; Maintenance Services</h2> 
<p>SDL shall provide telephone support to the Licensee for Supported Software Versions during the Principal Period of Maintenance. Licensee is responsible for all Customer contact and first line problem diagnosis unless direct Customer contact is requested by SDL.</p>

<p>Upon release of a major new software version designated by a change in the number to the left of the decimal - e.g. version 7.0 to version 8.0 (&ldquo;New Versions&rdquo;), SDL shall make these New Versions available to Licensee and Licensee&rsquo;s Customers. These New Versions offer major enhancements and new functionality and are made available as purchasable upgrades for standard maintenance customers. Customers under an active standard Maintenance program will be offered these New Versions at a substantial discount. In addition, Customers who elect an Initial Maintenance Agreement which commences upon Installation will receive New Versions free of charge during the Initial Maintenance Term. The Customer must take Delivery and Install the New Version within twelve (12) months of initial availability in order to qualify for the no charge Initial Maintenance New Version program. 
SDL Services required to implement Product Upgrades or New Versions, if any, are not included free and are considered Billable Services.</p>
<p>SDL shall, from time to time, distribute one set of user manual updates in electronic form providing new or updated manuals or supplements and revisions to existing manuals that pertain to the Products.
Upgrade and revision policies for purchased third party products shall be as defined in the appropriate third party Warranty and Maintenance Agreements. The incorporation or integration of third party product upgrades or new releases may require additional, funded development or billable technical services. In the event that the third party upgrade or new release requires such reintegration and Licensee requests SDL support for such reintegration, Licensee agrees to Order such services in an Order placed with SDL. Licensee should notify SDL prior to upgrading any third party product, operating system or database version to ensure compatibility with Products. </p>
<p>SDL shall provide the Products with Maintenance Services provided that the Licensee has taken all reasonable efforts and actions required to verify the existence of a reported Customer problem, and ascertain the conditions under which the problem can be repeated. Licensee agrees to provide sufficient information and assistance in support of SDL&rsquo;s remedial efforts. After examination of the problem, SDL shall perform one of the following actions as appropriate: (i) provide a patch, update or revision; (ii) provide a temporary bypass or workaround; (iii) provide a statement that the problem could not be verified and more data is necessary; or (iv) provide a statement that the problem is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant immediate correction, whereupon it will be considered for correction in a later Product Upgrade. </p>
<p>Maintenance services for software Products replaced by a Product Update may be discontinued ninety (90) days after delivery of the update. Maintenance services for software Products for which a major New Version has been made available may be discontinued upon a minimum of twelve (12) months notice. Maintenance Services will not be provided for problems that could have been prevented by implementation of a previously distributed Product Upgrade.</p>
<h2>Article 10 &ndash; Premium Maintenance Services</h2>
<p>In addition to the maintenance services defined in Section 9. Maintenance Services, the optional Premium Maintenance Services are made available upon confirmation in an Order.</p>
<p>Upon release of a major new software version designated by a change in the number to the left of the decimal - e.g. version 7.0 to version 8.0, SDL shall provide such New Version to Premium Maintenance Customers free of charge provided all eligibility requirements have been met. (See Section 6. Eligibility for Premium Maintenance). These New Versions offer major enhancements and new functionality. The Customer must take Delivery and Install the New Version within twelve (12) months of initial availability in order to qualify for the no charge program.</p>

<h2>Article 11 &ndash; Movement of Products</h2>
<p>Prior to any movement of Products from the Installation Site, or any transfer of Software to a new Compliant Platform, the Licensee shall give SDL at least thirty (30) days prior notice of such proposed movement and specify the proposed new location and platform environment. </p>
<p>Licensee or Customer shall be responsible for providing all services related to the actual movement and reconfiguration of the Products unless such services are contracted through SDL in an Order. Diagnosis and resolution of problems resulting from the movement or transfer of Software to a new platform are not covered under this Agreement if such movement or transfer was not contracted through SDL.</p>
